### Screw Theory for Rigid and Soft Robots

The following files were items gleaned from the screw theory tutorials at IROS2018 in Madrid. I thought the contents were so good that it was important to archive some of the materials that were used to teach here before they disappear from the eye of the public.

I do hope you enjoy them as much as I enjoyed attending the tutorials.
